# Crypto Swap Concept
Crypto swap concept based on Qt Quick Technology.
- The purpose of this project is to develop a design using Qt Quick technology.

## Template
- https://github.com/genyleap/Project-Template

## Building

- You need CMake tool for building source code
- CMake 3.23 or higher is required.

# Icons
- Due to the commercial of the fonts, we have not included it in the source list.
So to merge the icons into the path of the FontSystem.qml file, use the Pro version of FontAwesome for yourself.

```
cd build
cmake ..
make
./CryptoSwap

```
